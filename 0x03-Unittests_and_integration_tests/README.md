# 0x03. Unit Tests and Integration Tests

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This directory is part of the **Airbnb Clone - Backend (Python)** project.  
The focus here is on **testing**, an essential part of building reliable and maintainable software.

In this sprint, we strengthen our Airbnb clone by adding **unit tests** and **integration tests** to ensure that our code behaves as expected, is resilient to errors, and remains stable as the codebase evolves.

-  The difference between **unit tests** and **integration tests**.  
-  Common testing patterns such as **mocking, parametrizations, and fixtures**.  
-  How to write clean, maintainable tests that ensure correctness in complex systems.
